## Goals for this workshop
Oracle Analytics Cloud provides standalone data exploration and visualization. Oracle Analytics Cloud is the tool for quick exploration of sample data from multiple sources or for analysis and investigation of your own local data sets. It empowers business analysts and consumers with modern, AI-powered, self-service analytics capabilities, visualization, enterprise reporting, and natural language processing/generation.

Key Features of Oracle Analytics Cloud are:
- **Self-Service Data Discovery**. Creating visualizations and projects is easy in OAC because the application is designed to allow the data analysis process to be flexible and exploratory. OAC helps you to understand your data from a different perspective and fully explore your data to find a correlation, discover patterns and see trends. 
- **Analytics Dashboards**, all organizations want to enable interactive access to personalized information based on who we are and what we do. Dashboards aggregate content from a variety of sources and systems, present you with a personalized view of the data and let you fully interact with that data in a single, integrated experience.
- **Mobile Exploration**, for enabling to consult needed information every time and everywhere.
- **Data Connectors**, access to data, regardless of the source or location, is essential. Oracle ensures you have access to hybrid data—whether it’s on-premises, in the cloud, or on your desktop—from leading applications and data stores. More access to more data produces richer, more diverse analytics.
- **Collaboration and Publishing**, to take full advantage of your data, you need to easily share results with anyone, and collaborate smartly across teams to refine analytics content. Harness everyone’s collective wisdom to drive insights that lead to quick action and the best possible outcomes. 
- **Predictive Analytics**, you need simple, one-click actions along with powerful machine learning (ML) models to predict results and better understand your data. To help you deploy sophisticated analytics to everyone in your organization, Oracle Analytics is focused on embedding, consuming, and training ML models to enrich your data preparation, discovery, and collaboration.
